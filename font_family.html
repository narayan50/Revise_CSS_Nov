      It was 7 minutes after midnight. The dog was lying on the grass in the
      middle of the lawn in front of Mrs Shears’ house. Its eyes were closed. It
      looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they think
      they are chasing a cat in a dream. But the dog was not running or asleep.
      The dog was dead. There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog. The
      points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the
      ground because the fork had not fallen over. I decided that the dog was
      probably killed with the fork because I could not see any other wounds in
      the dog and I do not think you would stick a garden fork into a dog after
      it had died for some other reason, like cancer for example, or a road
      accident. But I could not be certain about this. I went through Mrs
      Shears’ gate, closing it behind me. I walked onto her lawn and knelt
      beside the dog. I put my hand on the muzzle of the dog. It was still warm.
      The dog was called Wellington. It belonged to Mrs Shears who was our
      friend. She lived on the opposite side of the road, two houses to the
      left. Wellington was a poodle. Not one of the small poodles that have
      hairstyles but a big poodle. It had curly black fur, but when you got
      close you could see that the skin underneath the fur was a very pale
      yellow, like chicken. I stroked Wellington and wondered who had killed
      him, and why. 3 My name is Christopher John Francis Boone. I know all the
      countries of the world and their capital cities and every prime number up
      to 7,057. Eight years ago, when I first met Siobhan, she showed me this
      picture [sad face] and I knew that it meant ‘sad,’ which is what I felt
      when I found the dead dog. Then she showed me this picturez
