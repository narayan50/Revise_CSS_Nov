     <h1>Freshly Brewd Coffee</h1>
     <p>From Egypt</p>
     <p>Coffee is a popular beverage made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee cherry, a fruit from the tropical evergreen coffee plant. The two main types of coffee beans are Arabica, known for its mild flavor, and Robusta, a hardier, more economical variety. Coffee is consumed worldwide for its stimulating effects from caffeine, which increases alertness and concentration. Brazil is the largest producer, while Finland is the largest consumer of coffee per capita</p>
